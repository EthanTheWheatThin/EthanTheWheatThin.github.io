        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My Name is Ethan and I currently attend Bancroft Middle School.
        I am currently 13 but will be 14 very soon. I have been playing the sport
        of golf ever since I was 4 or 5 and still play and enojoy it still to this day.
        I am in the 3 year ATM Computer Coding Program and enjoy it a lot.
        I hope to make the Varsity Golf Team when I move onto Highschool so my family
        can finally be proud of me for something that I have done in my life. 
        </p>

        <h2>My skills</h2>
        <p>Many of my skills are based in the field of electronics and basically things related to tech.
        For example I can work in many coding programs like Photoshop, Adobe Illustartor, Visual Studio Code, etc.
        Also outside of the tech world I am pretty decent at sports like basketballl, football, and golf.
