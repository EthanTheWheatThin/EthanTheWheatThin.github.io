        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p> For my High School choice, my decision is parted in a 3 way tie between, Lakewood, Millikan, or Poly. 
            Many of their programs are appealing to me because I don’t exactly know what I want to pursue for a career 
            or anything like that.

             <h2>My skills</h2>
                <p>Many of my skills are based in the field of electronics and basically things related to tech.

        Also outside of the tech world I am pretty decent at sports like basketballl, football, and golf.
